Alt Tab Mod: Only Raise Activated Window
========================================

GNOME Shell extension. Supports GNOME Shell 3.6.

When you Alt+Tab to an app (instead of Alt+<Key Above Tab> to a window), default behavior is to bring up all windows of the selected app and activate the most recently used. This extension modifies Alt+Tab to always bring up only the activated window.

OBS: not guaranteed to work together with other extensions that also modify Alt Tab popup. Tested only with 'Alt Tab Workspace' [1] and other 'Alt Tab Mod: ...'.
